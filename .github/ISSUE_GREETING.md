Hello,

Thank you for raising an issue. If the issue is a bug please do the following

1. Open neovim  
2. Run `:checkhealth easy-dotnet`  
3. Paste the result in your issue  

This makes it a lot easier for me to debug because a lot of the times it's important for me to see OS info, server version, plugin version, etc.. Thank you for understanding
